## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for the speaker impedance project. There are 3 main parts to the project:

1. **Analog Discovery 2** - This is the device that is used to measure the speaker impedance, and the Auto Impedance Collection V1.1.py script is used to automate the process of collecting the speaker impedance data through the Analog Discovery 2.

2. **Tympan** - This is the script that adapted code from the Tympan library to reproduce the impedance measurement process from the Analog Discovery 2 to using a Tympan. 

3. **Arduino Nano 33** - This code is being developed for part three of the project.
